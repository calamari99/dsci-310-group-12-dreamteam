Demo of Facebook-Post-Predictor from DSCI100.

## About
We attempt to build out a K-nearest neighbour classification model to predict a type of social media posting (ie: photo/video/status/etc.) using data mined from a cosmetic company's facebook page. The model performed mediocrely reporting an accuracy of ~92% due to an unbalanced dataset where videos, links, and statuses made up much less of the total observations in testing. 

The data is collected from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics

## Report
The analysis report is attached [here](https://github.com/calamari99/Facebook-Post-Predictor/blob/main/submission.ipynb).

## Usage
0a. Environment setup
- Install Docker in your computer.
- Log into Docker account.

1a. Clone Repo to local machine from linux terminal
- `Git clone https://github.com/calamari99/dsci-310-group-12-dreamteam.git`

2a. Move to repo folder and build docker image and file OR pull from hub in 2b
- `docker build -t <group12v5> .`

2b. Make sure Docker application is open and pull from docker with version needed for grading (version3.0 for milestone 2)
- `docker pull calamari99/group12v5:version3.0`

3a. Move to repo folder and initialize jupyter notebook using docker image from step 2. (Change version based on grading needs)
- `docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -v /$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work calamari99/group12v5:version3.0`
- NOTE: if you are using powershell, replace the `/$(pwd)` with `${PWD}` as follows: `${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work calamari99/group12v5:version3.0`

<!-- `docker container run -d -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_TOKEN=enter -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root --name test  â€“<dockerimage>` -->

<!--  Docker credential issues:
1. Logout of Docker:
` docker logout `

2. Build image with tag using:
` docker tag <imagename> <userID/imagename:tagname> 

3. Login to docker
` docker login `

4. Push image
` docker push <userID/imagename:tagname> 
-->

4a. Copy and paste the URL into a browser that was populated in step 3 starting with:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=<token>`

5. Move to notebooks folder, open `submission.ipynb` and run all cells.

---

Generate Report

1. To generate report as a html outout, move to home repository folder in a new terminal and run:
- `make`
- Note: the generated html file `notebook.html` will be populated in the notebooks/render folder
- Try using a gitbash terminal if make does not run in powershell/pc terminal.

2. To remove all outputs (vars/data/results) move to home repository folder and run:
- `make clean`
